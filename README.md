# C3DtoLISP
Project to expose various Civil 3D API functions through AutoLISP functions

This project was started with Civil 3D 2019, and is therefore setup with the .NET Framework 4.7 and targeting acad.exe to run Civil 3D 2019.

The idea behind this project is to create more LISP functions and enable direct access to as much of the Civil 3D API as possible
and/or feasible.
